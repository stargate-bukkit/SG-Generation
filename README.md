# Description
SG-ExtraFlags is an addon for Stargate adds a number of additional flags to the plugin!<br>
These flags were not included in the main plugin as they considerably alter SG's established syntax.

#### Features:
- [To be determined](https://github.com/stargate-rewritten/SG-ExtraFlags/issues)
  - The `L` flag, which generates a gate at the specified coordinates.
  - The `C` flag, which will leave a portal open for a specified amount of time once activated.
  - The `D` flag, which will destroy the portal after a certain period of time.
  - The `W` flag, which will randomly teleport the user somewhere into the world.
    - As an optional feature of the `W` flag, ruined portal structures will be used as the exit and will create a random network.
  - The `V` flag, which will hide a portal's sign interface.
  - The `E` flag, which will allow redstone to be used to activate the portal.
